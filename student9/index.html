        <h2> Human rights are the rights given to all people at birth around the world </h2>
        <p> An article that is being violated in India is Article 26: the right to education. This is because “While child labour can be an obstacle to education, at the same time education is instrumental in the prevention of child labour.  Through education, parents and children alike become more aware of its benefits, and the harm that child labour can cause.  And access to education helps reduce poverty, one of the root causes of child labour.”</p>
